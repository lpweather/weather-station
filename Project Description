#Project Description

The idea of this project is to create a weather station for individuals.

The original hackathon version will include a temperature and luminosity sensor.
The weather station will run on the Low Power Network provided by Swisscom.

In an future update we will add a pressure and humidity sensor. 
When the amount of data is enough, we will be able to make some near future meteo previsions.
